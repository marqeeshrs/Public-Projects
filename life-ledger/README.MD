# Project Title: “Life Ledger”
A personal system for managing the chaos of transition

## Purpose
A full-stack, privacy-first personal dashboard for people in high-transition phases (like me):
<stong>Unemployed → Employed<br>
Trucker → Coder<br>
Survivor → Architect of their future</strong>

<em>But unlike productivity apps that are sterile and corporate, this is raw, soulful, and built for humans who bleed through their trials and tribulations.</em>

## Core Features:
<ol>
<li>Task Tracker with Context
<ul>
Not just “to-do” lists, but “why-do” tags.<br>
E.g., “Apply to 3 jobs” → tagged with “financial stability” or “protect your dreams”
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Energy & Mood Journal
<ul>
Simple daily tracker: how you feel, why, and what you did.<br>
Charts or summaries to find patterns in burnout or bursts of brilliance.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Skill Progress Map
<ul>
Visual progression tree for my personal learning journey (JS, Python, etc)<br>
Checkbox-style nodes with descriptions, notes, and links.
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Think Space (your language)
<ul>
A protected text zone with zero formatting.<br>
Journaling, affirmations, plans, prayers. Untouchable by analytics. Yours alone.
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

## Tech Stack (<i>tentative</i>):
Frontend: React or Vue 

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB

Auth: Just local session for now; maybe expand to OAuth

Hosting: Vercel or Render

## Why so ambitious?
Personal relevance = long-term motivation

Emotional integration = standout portfolio piece

Full-stack challenge = stretching my learning edges

Scalable = easy to expand into an open-source tool or SaaS later

<p text-decoration="solid"><em> Optional Dream Expansion: </em></p><br>
Use AI to auto-summarize user's journal.

Add “personality metrics” (how much of your time aligns with your chosen values).

Connect with a community of others making major life transitions.

#### Mission Statement:
So much of our lives gets thrown into disarray and we can only plan for so much of it
before we feel the sting of the unexpected. I want this project to be like
a user's own internal sanctuary and throne room against the unexpected or...
perhaps to prepare for the known unknowns, to reclaim or reinforce one's 
agency in their life from first principles, not just for the sake of productivity.
