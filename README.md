I think people like apps that make them feel like they are doing more than what is presented...
but the features can't be convoluted or basic at face value... 
People also like a privacy... 
So I'll begin with the Journaling Space...
then I can fold other features in as functional derivatives of the user's ideas? 
Like tool tips that highlight certain words or phrases to signal certain features. 
Kinda like a magic 8-ball sort of deal but the magic is the 
user connecting their ideas with the tools hinted by their journaled thoughts?
<strong>Starting with the Journaling Space!</strong>
