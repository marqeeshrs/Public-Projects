I think people like apps that make them feel like they are doing more than what is presented...
but the features can't be convoluted or basic at face value... 
People also like a privacy... 
So I'll begin with the Journaling Space...
then I can fold other features in as functional derivatives of the user's ideas? 
Like tool tips that highlight certain words or phrases to signal certain features. 
Kinda like a magic 8-ball sort of deal but the magic is the 
user connecting their ideas with the tools hinted by their journaled thoughts?
<strong>Starting with the Journaling Space!</strong>

I haven't mad any updates in a while as I redirected my attention to learning JavaScript. I also encountered
a great deal more new information and languages by beginning this project. It is not beneath me to 
put myself to the grind stone to accomplish a task, but this is about learning things that I can
apply outside of this one project. Any person can copy and paste or perform a tutorial. But how am I going to
apply what I learned by performing the task? That's what I asked my self and took time to answer. 
I'll return to this soon.
